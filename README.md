# üîé OP Scan

OP Scan is a transaction explorer tailored specifically for the [OP Stack](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/chain-operators/tutorials/create-l2-rollup) and the [Superchain vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6vYNgrQ1LE).
You can use it locally to explore and monitor transactions on your own rollup developed with the OP Stack.

# üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Collaborate with us on OP Scan v1

OP Scan is built for teams working on their own rollup with the OP Stack.
If you are interested in monitoring your rollup locally and you want to submit a feature request or a bug, feel free by opening an issue in this repository.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

The app requires the following dependencies:

NodeJS >= 20
pnpm >= 9

# üë©‚Äçüíª Local Development

For contributing to the project, you can quickly get the application running by following these steps:

Clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:walnuthq/op-scan
```

Install the dependencies:

```
pnpm install
```

You will need to create a `.env.local` file in the root of your repository and populate it with `NEXT_PUBLIC_L1_RPC_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_L2_RPC_URL`.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_L1_RPC_URL="https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_L2_RPC_URL="https://opt-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/..."
```

You can get free node rpcs url by signing up to services such as [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) or [Infura](https://www.infura.io/).

If you're running the indexer, you will also need to setup a websocket connection to the L2 chain:

Start up the app and see it running at `http://localhost:3000`

```
pnpm dev
```

# üóÇÔ∏è Running the indexer

To run the indexer, you first need to setup your `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local` as well as websocket connections to your L1/L2 chains (once again you can get them from a 3rd-party provider):

```
DATABASE_URL="file:dev.db"
L1_RPC_WSS="wss://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/..."
L2_RPC_WSS="wss://opt-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/..."
```

Then you can sync your local database with the Prisma schema:

```
pnpm prisma:db:push
```

We use [Bun](https://bun.sh/) to run the indexer as a long-running script so make sure it is installed globally on your system.
Now you will be able to start indexing the blockchain by running the `op-indexer` command:

```
pnpm op-indexer
```

You should start seeing blocks getting indexed in your terminal and you can explore the state of your local database using Prisma studio:

```
pnpm prisma:studio
```

If you need to change the Prisma schema at some point, make sure to regenerate the Prisma client and push to your local database:

```
pnpm prisma:generate
pnpm prisma:db:push
```
