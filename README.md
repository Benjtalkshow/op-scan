# üîé OP Scan

OP Scan is a transaction explorer tailored specifically for the [OP Stack](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/chain-operators/tutorials/create-l2-rollup) and the [Superchain vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6vYNgrQ1LE).
You can use it locally to explore and monitor transactions on your own rollup developed with the OP Stack.
